# 🏊 Intex & Bestway Pool Threads for Fusion 360

This repository provides **custom thread definitions** for Autodesk Fusion 360 to model and 3D print parts compatible with **Intex®** and **Bestway®** pool fittings.

These thread profiles are **reverse-engineered** from actual fittings and formatted to work with Fusion 360’s thread library.

---

## 📦 Included Files

- **`IntexThreads.xml`** – Metric‑style (60°) thread profiles  
- **`IntexThreadsWithworth.xml`** – Whitworth‑style (55°) thread profiles  
- Each file contains **internal** and **external** threads grouped under single designations (e.g. `INTEX‑55x3`)  
- Dimensions tuned for **3D printing** (clearances slightly increased for FDM and resin)

## ⚙️ Official Installation Instructions

Follow Autodesk’s guidance on how to install custom threads in Fusion 360, including where to place XML files so they appear in the Thread tool:

## ⚠️ Accuracy & Recommended Test Printing

> **Important Safety Notice:**  
These thread definitions were created **without access to precision metrology tools** and may not be 100% accurate.

It is **strongly recommended** to:
1. Print a small **test part (like a ring or plug)** using **PLA** (cheaper & easier to test).
2. Verify **fit and clearance** before printing large or UV‑stable parts.

After verifying, you may proceed to print in more appropriate materials like ASA, PETG, or UV-resistant resin.
